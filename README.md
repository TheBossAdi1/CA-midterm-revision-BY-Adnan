------------------------------------------------------------------
*NOTE: I will update this archive every 10 videos 
       and after adding Flash Cards and Quiz questions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: It is prefered to:
1- Watch all the videos.
2- Review each Mind Map I made.
3- Solve all of the quiz questions I will be adding to this archive.
4- Maybe check the Flash Cards that I might add after finishing
